Developing a Spring Boot application for a demo university system using PostgreSQL, Java Persistence API (JPA), and Thymeleaf involves several key steps. Below, I outline the general process to create such an application:

1. Setup Your Development Environment
Java Development Kit (JDK): Install JDK 11 or later.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA.
Database: Install PostgreSQL and set up a local database instance.
Build Tool: Configure Maven for dependency management.
2. Initialize Your Spring Boot Project
Use Spring Initializr to bootstrap your project:

Project: Choose Maven.
Language: Select Java.
Spring Boot Version: Choose the latest stable version.
Project Metadata: Define group and artifact IDs.
Dependencies:
*Spring Web
*Spring Data JPA
*PostgreSQL Driver
*lombok
*Thymeleaf
*Spring Boot DevTools (optional for live reload)
3. Configure Application Properties
In src/main/resources/application.properties, configure the database connection and other application settaings.
4. Create Domain Models
Define your entity classes in the model package. For example, a simple Uinversity.
5. Repository Layer
Create JPA repositories in the repository package for database operations.
6. Service Layer
Implement the business logic in the service package.
7. Controller Layer
Create controllers in the controller package to handle HTTP requests.
8. Thymeleaf Templates
Create Thymeleaf templates in src/main/resources/templates. For instance, home.html to display home page.

9. Run Your Application
Run your Spring Boot application either directly from your IDE.

10. Test Your Application
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the list of universities and ensure that your application is running correctly.

This basic guide should help you get started with a demo university application using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, JPA, and Thymeleaf.
